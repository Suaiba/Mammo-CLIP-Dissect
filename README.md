#Mammo-CLIP Dissect

"Mammo-CLIP Dissect" is a framework for analyzing the internal representations of deep learning vision models applied to mammography. It extends concept-based interpretability methods to mammography-specific Vision–Language Models (VLMs), enabling researchers to study how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and VLMs learn clinically meaningful concepts.

This repository contains the code, scripts, and instructions to reproduce the experiments described in our paper:
